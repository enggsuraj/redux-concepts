Redux state management practice and documentation

## 1. What is a State

üé≤ The state of our app is all the data in our application that we have to keep track of for it to work. For example Whether a user is signed in or a guest. And based off of that data, the user message shows the authenticated message "Welcome back!" or the unauthenticated message "You must sign in!". So the authentication status is one piece of state.

üóÇ Application state is: it‚Äôs like a global object which holds information that you use for various purposes later in the app (e.g. making decisions on which components to render and when, rendering the stored data etc).

ü§î You might be asking why we need this word state. If state is nothing more than data in our application, why don't developers refer to it as app data?

üëç One reason we have a specific term 'state' is to describe how our application change with the data over time. State is important because it tells us the status of our application at any moment. Think of it like an individual frame of a movie.

## 2. State Management

‚úî One popular way to manage state across many JavaScript libraries (such as React and Redux) is using objects. 

## 3. Redux

‚öõÔ∏è Redux is a popular JavaScript library for managing the state of your application. 

Before we dive into Redux, I want to mention two crucial patterns that Redux follows (and I would highly recommend you to always keep this information in the back of your mind while writing your Redux applications!):

‚ñ∂ One pattern that Redux follows is called ‚ÄúSingle Source Of Truth‚Äù, which means that we have only one place (called Store) where we store the only state for the whole application.

#### In other words, one app ‚Äî one store ‚Äî one state.

‚ñ∂ Another pattern that Redux follows is called ‚Äúimmutability‚Äù. And you will find this term quite often in other frameworks and libraries as well.
In short, immutability means that we don‚Äôt change the state object and its properties directly. Instead, we make a new object, recalculate the new application state and update it with our newly created object. We want to leave our old state object intact.

## 4. When not to use Redux?
* Tight Budget
* Small and medium size apps
* Simple UI.data flow
* Static data

## 5. Three Building Blocks 

* Actions
* Reducers
* Store

## STORE 

-  The store hold the state of the application.
-  The store is actually an object, not a class.
-  We create only one store per application.

## ACTIONS

- Actions are plain JavaScript objects that describe WHAT happened, but don‚Äôt describe HOW the app state changes.
- We just dispatch (send) them to our store instance whenever we want to update the state of our application.

## History

Some years ago, FLUX had become the standard to manage the states with Reactjs. This way of working combined with its structure of Actions, Dispatchers, Reducers and so on, created a standard which would be applied to the subsequent libraries for lots of applications.

From the bases of this library, we would obtain Redux, which is probably the most well-known library. However, nowadays, and depending on the type of project we are creating and the framework/library we are using, we will find different options.

The different alternatives we would have for our generic project, would be:
* Redux
* Mobx for Vuejs
* Context API for React
