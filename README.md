## 1. What is a State>

🎲 The state of our app is all the data in our application that we have to keep track of for it to work. For example Whether a user is signed in or a guest. And based off of that data, the user message shows the authenticated message "Welcome back!" or the unauthenticated message "You must sign in!". So the authentication status is one piece of state.

🤔 You might be asking why we need this word state. If state is nothing more than data in our application, why don't developers refer to it as app data?

👍 One reason we have a specific term 'state' is to describe how our application change with the data over time. State is important because it tells us the status of our application at any moment. Think of it like an individual frame of a movie.
